## School_District_Analysis

# Project Overview
  In this project, we used Python and Pandas to pull data and display it elsewhere, with more structure and organization. We were tasked with performing a school district analysis using Jupyter Notebook. The purpose of this assignment was to provide key metrics and data of each school and its district. Using the school data file, specicific data on students could be loaded into dataframes from csv's to view trends and overall performance. Some data was removed and further analzyed. 

# Results

Using Jupyter Notebook files from local directories, a developmental environment was created to read the CSV file as a DataFrame with structured columns and functions. Mathematical calculations were performed on the DataFrame. Changes in data were very incremental. Percent passing and overall numbers dropped slightly.

# Summary

The Average Scores, Passing Scores, and Overall Passing Scores each vary in total slightly over the comparison.
